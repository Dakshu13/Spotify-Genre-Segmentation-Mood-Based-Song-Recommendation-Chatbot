# ðŸŽµ Spotify Genre Segmentation + Mood-Based Song Recommendation Chatbot

Spotifyâ€™s music recommendation system is known for its accuracy. It suggests songs based on listening history and clusters similar audio features to identify genres and moods.

In this project, we recreate a simplified version of that process using **KMeans clustering** and build a **simple AI chatbot** to suggest songs based on cluster (genre/mood).

### ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow

1. **Load the Spotify Dataset**  
   Import the dataset containing audio features of various songs.

2. **Clean the Data**  
   Handle missing values and drop irrelevant columns.

3. **Visualize Audio Features**  
   Use scatter plots to compare audio characteristics like `danceability`, `energy`, `key`, etc., and find patterns.

4. **Apply KMeans Clustering**  
   Fit a KMeans model to group songs into 6 clusters representing moods/genres:
   - `pop`, `rap`, `rock`, `latin`, `r&b`, and `edm`.

5. **Visualize Clusters**  
   Plot the clusters using `hue="clustergroup"` in Seaborn to understand separation.

6. **(Optional)**:  
   Create bar graphs to show the number of songs in each cluster for visual clarity.

7. **Evaluate Clustering**
   Calculate the **Silhouette Score** to measure cluster quality.  
   *Score achieved:* **0.62**, indicating strong and well-separated clusters.

8. Build a Simple Chatbot ðŸ¤–  
   Create a rule-based chatbot using `if-else` conditions.  
   The chatbot:
   - Greets the user
   - Asks for a preferred music mood (mapped to cluster)
   - Recommends top 10 songs (by name) from the selected cluster
